The idea behind this project is to facilitate the fast-food business community, this this project I will use Fast food points data set of US.
The data set contain the information of almost 10000 fast food points throughout the country with Lists US. Specifies the address, city, country, keys,
Longitude Latitude. postal Code, province, and websites. 
By using this data set I will try to recommend the best point for fast-food to the fast food chain owners or 
if any one wants to start a new fast food point in US or a specific provenance or city as well. I will also try to explore which area is hub of the fast food points.
